          <h3>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
          <p>
            When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process,
            we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email
            address. <br />
            When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet
            protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about
            your browser and operating system. <br />
            Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our
            store, new products and other updates.
          </p>

          <h3>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>How do you get my consent?</strong> <br />
            When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your
            credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that
            you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. <br />
            If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will
            either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity
            to say no.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How do I withdraw my consent?</strong> <br />
            If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to
            contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any
            time, by contacting us at hello@kushals.com

          </p>

          <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>
          <p>
            We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you
            violate our Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <h3>SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY</h3>
          <p>
            Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform
            that allows us to sell our products and services to you. <br />
            Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases, and the general Shopify
            application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Payment:</strong></p>
          <p>
            If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores
            your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security
            Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is
            necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase
            transaction information is deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI
            Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard,
            American Express, and Discover.
          </p>
          <p>
            PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our
            store and its service providers.

            .
          </p>

          <h3>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>
          <p>
            In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose
            your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they
            provide to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other
            payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the
            information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can
            understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these
            providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that
            are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to
            proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider,
            then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which
            that service provider or its facilities are located.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a
            payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in
            completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States
            legislation, including the Patriot Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or
            application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of
            Service.
          </p>

          <h3>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h3>
          <p>
            To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry
            best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed,
            disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using
            secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with AES-256 encryption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100%
            secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted
            industry standards.
          </p>
